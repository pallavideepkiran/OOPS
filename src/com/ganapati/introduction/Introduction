New keyword dynamically allocates the memory at run time and returns the reference to it, and ref is stored in variable.

object are stored in heap memory, and reference variable stored in stack
reference points to object
All class object in java are allocated dynamically

Dynamically memory allocation -
Student student = new Student();
----------------< happens at compile time()
                 -----------------< happens at run time

student is the reference variable that holds the memory address of object in teh heap
accessing the address is not allowed in java

When you create an object of a class, it means the class is instantiated

the default value of object is null
the default value of primitives like int is 0, boolean is false

Student() < is a constructor
constructor defines what happens when an object is created
constructor is used to instantiate the variable of the object
constructor is a special function that runs when you create an object and it allocates some variables

default constructor Student()
to bind the argument with the object we define custom constructor(constructor overloading)
Student(13,"Ganeshji")


this keyword is used to access the object inside the template(class)
this is replaced with reference variable/current object

to call a constructor from a constructor, use this
like: Student(){
    this(15,"Ganeshji")
}
Student(int rno, String name) {}


In java primitive are not implemented as object and are not stored in heap memory and re stored in stack memory

Wrapper class:
used to convert a primitive datatype to an Object

when you pass object as argument, reference is passed

Final:
final variable has to be initialized when declared, as you can not modify it.
final guarantee immutability only when instance variable are primitive datatype
when a non primitive is final, we can reassign the instance variable but not the non primitive object

Finalize:
java will not allow you to destroy an object manually but it gives you the option to perform some action when it destroys the object
finalize keyword is used to specify what to do when the object is destroyed/reclaimed by garbage collector
finalize is used to specify the specific actions when the object is about to be taken away by garbage collector
finalize is called when java do a garbage collection
finalize at class level means that whenevr any object of that class is destroyed in memory by garbage collector, steps defined in finallize menthod will be performed.
